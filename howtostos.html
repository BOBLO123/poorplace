        <h2>Flashing And Booting</h2>
        <h3>Prerequisites:</h3>
        <p># Usb flash drive</p>
        <p># Chromebook</p>
        <p># Computer that is not school-sanctioned</p>
        <p># A <a href="">Terra OS image</a></p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Flashing</h3>
        <p>I reccomend a usb that's at least 30gb in size.</p>
        <p>If you plan on actually using this often, get at least 64gb, and to play games 120gb is reccomended.</p>
        <p>First, boot up your computer (not chromebook) and go <a href="https://rufus.ie/en/">Here</a> for windows pc's</p>
        <p>If you can't use Rufus (on linux, mac or otherwize) I recommend <a href="https://etcher.balena.io/">Balena Etcher</a></p>
        <p>Start by launching one of the provided flashing utilities</p>
        <p>Then flash the usb drive with the Terra OS image, eject the usb drive, and <a href="">Start Booting</a></p>
