    <h2>Here things get a bit more complex...</h2>

    <h3>Expanding your partition</h3>
    <p>Sign in with the username terraos and pasword terraos.</p>
    <p>Once logged in, you have a few options:</p>
    <p># Expand my unnoficial way (reccomended)</p>
    <p># Expand the funny way (reccomended)</p>
    <p># Stop using Terra OS (reccomended)</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>My way</h3>
    <p>The way I like to expand is pretty simple:</p>
    <p>I boot into a linux install, and open my disk manager.</p>
    <p>Then I just select my partition and resize it to max capacity</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>The funny way</h3>
    <p>In Terra OS, open your file explorer and go to /, search firefox and wait.</p>
    <p>Once you see a folder like /firefox/, find its path.</p>
    <p>Open a terminal. Then run the simple command: sudo rm -r (path to firefox)</p>
    <p>Now you should have enough room to update and install my favorite disk manager</p>
    <p>All you gotta do is run "sudo pacman -Syu gnome-disk-utility"</p>
    <p>After installation with (hopefully) no errors, go to your application launcher and search "disks"</p>
    <p>Launch you application and find you usb, the find the partition directly left of the free space, right click and select resize,</p>
    <p>Then make it fill your desired amount of space</p>
